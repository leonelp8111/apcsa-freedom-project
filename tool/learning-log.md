* Im surprised it actualluy uses scenes like it did for kaboom,
* To start making your game you will need to define a player a mob/enemy type character, and a HUD
* To define the player it can be done even before testing the other aspects of the game
* Choose the root node the player object will be connected to (Add an Area20 noode)
* Area20 checks like any collisions or anything that cross the player
